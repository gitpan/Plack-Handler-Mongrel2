    * Tested against mongrel2-1.5
    * Adapt to mongrel2 changes
    * use ZeroMQ 0.08 for ZeroMQ::Raw and much better behaved
      memory management code
    * Use Plack::TempBuffer for psgi.input
    * Fix test numbering

0.01000_02 Sep 01 2010
    * Tested against mongrel2-1.0rc1 (released Sept 1)
    * Work with new m2sh
    * Max content length is now configurable in mongrel2, so the
      tests were enabled back.
    * Known issues:
        - Somewhere along the lines in the tests I'm not being able to 
          kill the handlers using regular measures, so I'm resorting to
          using SIGKILL. I know it's bad manners. Patches welcome.

    * Known issues:
        - Mongrel2 has a fixed max content length for POST requests.
